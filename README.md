# Vitimize

Victimize is a python wrapper script for running redhat victims.
This essentially eliminates the lengthy commandline usage or in creation of alias (as described by Redhat)

## Installation

The installation process is simple. Just run the setup.sh shell script (uses privileges for few actions)


python requirements.txt has 3 python libraries

1. lxml for pom.xml 
2. python-magic for file mime types
3. python wheel (replacement for python egg)

The setup script will take care of installation. To get started, clone this repository and run 'setup.sh'.
